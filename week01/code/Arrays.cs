        //Part 1: Arrays
        // PLAN (step by step):
        // 1) Create a double array with the size "length".
        // 2) Fill each position i of the array with the appropriate multiple:
        //    - The first element (index 0) should be "number" (that is, number * 1).
        //    - The second element (index 1) should be "number * 2", and so on...
        //    - General formula: result[i] = number * (i + 1).
        // 3) Return the filled array.
        //
        // Notes:
        // - It is assumed that "length" > 0 (as stated in the problem).
        // - The type is double to allow fractional "number" if necessary.
